# PetHub

Provide users of our app a portal to search currently available dogs & cats up for adoption, all in one place.  Our intention is to save the user the time and effort needed to scour multiple sites across the internet to complete a comprehensive search.    

## Demonstration of the application

Link to Heroku: https://fast-oasis-66568.herokuapp.com/

## Technologies used

* MongoDB – Database
* Express Server & Node – Backend
* React – Frontend
* Redux – React Component State Management
* Passport & JWT – User Authentication & Authorization

## Future improvements

 - Add additional data sources via Cheerio scrapes and additional API's for a more         comprehensive search
 - Develop a user account access page whereby users can edit registration information, as well as save, manage and take notes on a list of potential adoptees the user has “dog-eared” as interested.
 - Develop a more comprehensive search interface with additional parameters such as, age range, activity level, color, etc.
 - Develop a questionaire and algorithm to match potential adopters with adoptees, based on the answers of the survey.
 - Develop research tools regarding breeds to aid users in selecting an appropriate breed.
 - Develop an interface for users to submit a pet for adoption directly to our database.
